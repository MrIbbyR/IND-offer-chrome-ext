3. Choose **Keywords** or **Boolean** mode.

## Technical Notes

- **No remote code**: no CDN, no `eval`, no `new Function`. MV3 compliant.
- **No build step**: source files are shipped directly.
- **Shadow DOM**: all DOM access uses `walkShadow` / `queryDeepSelectorAll` utilities to pierce SmartRecruiters custom elements (`spl-button`, `spl-tab`, `sr-link`).
- **Anti-detection**: all navigation timing uses `jitter(baseMs)` (±35% randomisation). Worker tabs are reused across URLs rather than opened fresh each time.
- **Service worker**: stateless by design. Only the active parallel keyword queue is held in memory; all other config is read from `chrome.storage.local` or `sessionStorage` per message.
